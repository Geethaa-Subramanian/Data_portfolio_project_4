# Portfolio Project 4 üíª

### **1. Overview**

This project demonstrates my proficiency in **Python** for building and evaluating a predictive model. I used a public dataset from a telecom company to create a machine learning model that predicts customer churn.

### **2. The Challenge** üéØ

The objective was to identify and predict which customers are likely to churn, or discontinue their service. This is a crucial business challenge, as customer retention is often more cost-effective than customer acquisition.

### **3. My Approach** üõ†Ô∏è

As part of my **SkilloVilla Data Analytics course**, I followed a standard machine learning workflow. My methodology included:

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Cleaned the raw data, handled missing values, and transformed categorical variables.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed in-depth analysis to understand key factors influencing churn, such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created new features to improve the model's predictive power.
* **Model Building:** Developed and trained a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to predict churn.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

### **4. Outcome & Key Insights** ‚ú®

The project resulted in a predictive model with an accuracy of **85%**. The analysis revealed that **contract type** (month-to-month contracts), **monthly charges**, and **tenure** were the strongest predictors of churn. These insights can be used to inform targeted customer retention strategies.
